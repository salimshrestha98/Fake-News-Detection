# Fake News Detection
### Analysis of the performance of various machine learning algorithms while performing classification of Fake news articles.


This is a part of final year project that I performed during my undergraduate course. In this project, I have tried to compare the efficiency and accuracy of various machine learning algorithms in classifying Fake News from Real News.

#### Dataset Description
```
train.csv: A full training dataset with the following attributes:

id: unique id for a news article
title: the title of a news article
author: author of the news article
text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable
1: unreliable
0: reliable
test.csv: A testing training dataset with all the same attributes at train.csv without the label.

```
